## 9/11 What is Play? A brief intro to “play theory”
### readings/in class   
* Ian Bogost, from *Play Anything* (2016), ch1
* Johan Huizinga, from *Homo Ludens* (1938)

* Choose a public-domain text to render “playable” for the Group Project

### work due
* **Blog Post #1:** Apply one or more of the theorizations of play that we've read to a game or other instance of play in your life. You might consider how play practices inscribe a "magic circle" that seems to exist outside of ordinary time and space per Huizinga, you might explore the structuralist divisions of Caillois's work to specify the particular balance of play modes in your example, or you might consider more holistically, per Bogost's work, how play enhances, or might enhance, aspects of your life.
