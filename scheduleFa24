## 9/5 What is Play? A brief intro to “play theory”
### readings/in class   
* Ian Bogost, from *Play Anything* (2016), ch1
* Johan Huizinga, from *Homo Ludens* (1938)
* Roger Caillois, from *Man, Play, and Games* (1958)
* Lewis Carroll, *Alice in Wonderland* (get as far as you can, but lower priority than the above: feel free to grab a free open-source edition like [Project Gutenberg's](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-h/11-h.htm) for convenience.

### work due
* **Blog Post #1:** Apply one or more of the theorizations of play that we've read to a game or other instance of play in your life. You might consider how play practices inscribe a "magic circle" that seems to exist outside of ordinary time and space per Huizinga, you might explore the structuralist divisions of Caillois's work to specify the particular balance of play modes in your example, or you might consider more holistically, per Bogost's work, how play enhances, or might enhance, aspects of your life. Posts should be 500-800 words and fairly informal but should reference (a) specific reading/s.

What are the pleasures and pitfalls of this modality of "gameful work/life"?
